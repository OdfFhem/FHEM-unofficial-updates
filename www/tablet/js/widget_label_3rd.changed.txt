  - adjust coloring

    coloring happens after applying of data-substitution and data-map-get;
    old method ignored these value-changing attributes.
    
    example: --- reading value in FHEM is 4992
             !!! old coloring based on 4992
             data-substitution='["4992","2994"]'
             data-map-get='{"2994":"9924"}'
             !!! new coloring based on 9924
